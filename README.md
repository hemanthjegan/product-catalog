## 📌 Context
This project is an **internal tool** for managing the product catalog of an eCommerce platform.  

The platform currently sells **dresses** and **shoes**, and expands into new categories (e.g., **watches, smartphones, grooming products, accessories**) every 6 months.  

Each category has unique attributes:  
- **Smartphones** → OS, RAM, Battery Size  
- **Watches** → Dial Color, Dial Size, Strap Type  

The tool enables internal users (merchandisers, category managers) to:  
- Define new product categories and their specific attributes  
- Create, update, and manage products with category-specific attributes  
- Ensure **data integrity** and **scalability** for future category expansion

## 🚀 Steps & Deliverables

### **Step 1: Database Design**
- Designed a **scalable, normalized relational schema** that supports:
  - Dynamic product categories
  - Category-specific custom attributes
  - Product creation & updates
- Deliverables:
  - **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)**:  
    ( available in [product_catalog_erd.drawio](docs/product_catalog_erd.drawio))
  - **Justification**:  
    - Normalized to avoid duplication  
    - Flexible: new categories & attributes can be added without schema changes  
    - Future-proof: supports scalable product catalog growth  

---

### **Step 2: Class Design**
- Based on the database schema, created a **UML Class Diagram** to represent system structure.
- Deliverables:
  - **Class Diagram**:  
    (available in [product_catalog_uml.drawio](docs/product_catalog_uml.drawio))
- Design highlights:
  - Clear **class relationships** (Category, Attribute, Product, etc.)  
  - Key **methods & responsibilities** for managing attributes & products  
  - Extensible design for future categories  

---

### **Step 3: Implementation**
- Implemented the internal tool using **.NET Framework 4.7, ASP.NET MVC, and ADO.NET**.
- Functionality includes:
  - **Category Management** (add/update/delete categories)
  - **Attribute Management** (define per-category attributes)
  - **Product Management** (CRUD operations with category-specific attributes)
- Backend built with **ADO.NET** for direct database interaction.  
- Follows **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture for clean separation of concerns.
